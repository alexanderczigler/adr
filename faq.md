# Frequently Asked Questions

## I have a question that isn't answered here. What do I do?

We're still pretty new and haven't built up a long list of frequently asked
questions, so if you have a question not answered here, you can always
[ask us on GitHub](https://github.com/straw-hat-team/adr/issues/new) by filing an
issue.

And if you already know the answer to a question that would be helpful for others,
**send us a pull request** adding it to this page!
